Parallelization of KMeans Clustering using OpenMP

Explore and write a sequential program for K-Means clustering, where the input data is a set of 2D (x,y) data points given in the link below.
Parallelize the loops of the clustering using OpenMP.

Perform experiments comparing the execution time of OpenMP and the sequential codes. For this assignment, we will use K=20 for the number of clusters. Your program should output 20 lines, each for a cluster formed, containing the fields: cluster index, number of points in the cluster and centroid of the points in the cluster.. Perform the following explorations:

	1. Static vs dynamic schedule clause in OpenMP for loop
	2. Perform experiments for OpemMP threads - 4, 8 and 16.
For each experiment with a fixed number of threads, and for the sequential program, run 5 times, and obtain the average execution time across these 5 runs.

Prepare a report containing:
	1. Methodology
	2. Experimental setup
	3. Results containing execution times and speedup with the above options, both as tables and graphs with x and y axes properly labeled.
	4. Observations.
