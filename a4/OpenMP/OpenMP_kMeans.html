<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parallelization of KMeans Clustering using OpenMP</span></h2>Explore and write a sequential program for K-Means clustering, where
the input data is a set of 2D (x,y) data points given in the link below.<p>Parallelize the loops of the clustering using OpenMP.</p><p>Perform
experiments comparing the execution time of OpenMP and the sequential
codes. For this assignment, we will use K=20 for the number of
clusters. Your program should output 20 lines, each for a cluster
formed, containing the fields: cluster index, number of points in the
cluster and centroid of the points in the cluster.. Perform the
following explorations:</p><ul><li>Static vs dynamic schedule clause in OpenMP for loop</li><li>Perform experiments for OpemMP threads - 4, 8 and 16.</li></ul>For each experiment with a
fixed number of threads, and for the sequential program, run 5 times,
and obtain the average execution time across these 5 runs. <br><br>Prepare a report containing:<br><ul><li>Methodology</li><li>Experimental setup</li><li>Results
containing execution times and speedup with the above options, both as
tables and graphs with x and y axes properly labeled.</li><li>Observations.&nbsp;</li></ul>Input data - <a href="data/data_20k.csv">data</a><br><br>
